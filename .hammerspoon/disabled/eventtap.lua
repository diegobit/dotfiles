# Eventtap module

## Basic handling

In a perfect world, we'd only have two scenarios for key presses:

**Chorded combinations:** User holds down a modifier, and while it is down,
presses and releases another key. For example, to clear the terminal
(Control-L):

    Control *--------------*
          L       *----*

**Normal typing:** User presses and releases one key after another. For example,
to type "BAR":

          B *----*
          A         *----*
          R                 *----*

In practice, reality is more complicated. Users typing quickly typically engage
in "roll-over" in which successive keys are pressed before the preceding key is
released:

          B *----*
          A     *----*
          R         *----*

This also happens for chorded combinations. The user may be have the mental
model of "hold down a modifier, and while it is down, press and release another
key", but in reality many instances of this end up being roll-over scenarios
too:

    Control *----*
          L     *----*

This becomes a problem for us here where we have multi-role "conditional" keys,
that should be:

1. One key (such as "Backspace" or "Enter") when tapped.
2. That key, repeated, when pressed and held.
3. A modifier (such as "Control") when chorded with another key.

Give such a key, how are we to distinguish between these two cases?

      Control *----*
            L     *----*

    Backspace *----*
            L     *----*

The same keys are pressed, with the same timing, but in one case the user
intends to chord a combination and in the other he/she intends to delete a
character and type another.

Based on logging millisecond-level timing information and observing my own
typing, I've found that most chording events happen in the 70-200ms range (that
is, time elapsed between the modifier going down and the companion key going
down). The key repeat delay is ~416ms, and the repeat interval is ~33ms.

The heuristic applied here, then, is that if a key follows a potential modifier
by less than a threshold of 200ms, we assume that the user intends to chord and
fire the combination immediately. This matches the behavior of normal modifier
keys, which fire their combination immediately upon key-down.

If the threshold is exceeded, but still less than the repeat delay (416ms), we
put the event into a pending queue so that we can decide whether it is a chord
or a roll-over based on when key-up (or an autorepeating key-down) arrives. If
we see a key-up event before 416ms, we consider this to be a tap (ie. we assume
roll-over rather than a chord). The risk of a false positive here is not too
concerning: worst that can happen is we wind up doing something like
"Backspace-then-insert-space", which is generally unlikely to be a destructive
operation. In a nut-shell: the essence of this heuristic is that, for these
special keys:

- The very fastest rollovers are likely to be chording attempts.
- For not-quite-as-fast rollovers, we assume tap attempts, to make it possible
  for the user to do quick erase then insert.
- It's always possible to force a chording interpetation by doing a strict
  chord, in which the other key is released before the modifier
  (notwithstanding the fact that pressing and holding the modifier for long
  enough without explictly initiating a chord or a rollover will trigger an
  autorepeating tap).

This level of nuance is almost certainly overkill, but the ability to enqueue
pending events will come in handy when we come to implement the SpaceFN layout,
when it will be absolutely necessary to block processing until we see key-up.

The threshold is customizable, so I have it tuned very fast on the "Caps Lock"
side, where I tend to do very fast inwards rolls, while on the "Return" side I
opt for a higher threshold matching the repeat delay (416ms). This means that
any press within that window is considered a chord. It's possible that this is
too sensitive, making it harder to type fast roll-over sequences involving
"Return-followed-by-something-else".

## SpaceFN layout

When I implement this layer, things are going to get more complicated.
In the basic case, we must support this:

    Space *----*
        N      *----*

That is, fast typing with frequent rollover (very common when using the space
key), but also:

    Space *-----------*
        N      *----*

That is, the intent to activate the SpaceFN layer, meaning that we have to defer
emitting the space until we've seen the key-up event from the "N" key (subject
to a time out).

So far, that's definitely within the realm of the straighforwardly
implementable, but bear in mind that we will want to deal with modifiers as
well. For example, consider that we want to move back a word by doing
"Option-Space-N":

    Option *---------------*
     Space   *------------*
         N         *---*

Again, not too bad, but consider when we want to combine this with a
multi-purpose key again:

   Caps Lock *-----------------*
       Space    *-------------*
           N           *----*

This might be a little tricky to reconcile with my use of Control-Space as my
tmux prefix.
